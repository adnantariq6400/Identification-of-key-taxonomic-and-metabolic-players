# Identification-of-key-taxonomic-and-metabolic-players-in-the-gut-metagenome-of-T2D-Patients
Metagenome Project

This project aims to identify significant microbial taxa and metabolic functions associated with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) using metagenomic data. Through computational analysis of gut microbiome samples, we explore microbial composition and functional signatures to uncover key players involved in host-microbiome interactions related to T2D.

## 🧬 Objectives

- Analyze gut metagenomic data from T2D patients and healthy controls.
- Identify differentially abundant microbial taxa.
- Profile and compare metabolic pathways across groups.
- Integrate taxonomic and functional data to discover key microbial signatures.
